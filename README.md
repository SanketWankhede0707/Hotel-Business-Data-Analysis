## Business Objectives Attained

### Conclusion
For the hotel business to flourish, it is crucial to consider high revenue generation, customer satisfaction, and employee retention. The following objectives were achieved:

1. **Revenue Generation Overview:**
    - By displaying the high revenue-generating months through a pie chart distribution.

2. **Revenue Enhancement:**
    - Increased revenue was achieved by presenting a bar chart distribution of the most reserved room types and the busiest months for visitors.

3. **Client Preparation:**
    - Clients can prepare well in advance to minimize grievances. 

4. **Addressing Outliers:**
    - Outliers, such as a significant decrease in Average Daily Rate (ADR) when the number of visitors is higher, were identified. In off-seasons, the client can engage with offices for bulk booking, which will also contribute to extra revenue generation.

5. **Visitor Arrival Trends:**
    - The trend of visitor arrivals at client locations was shown, enabling clients to engage visitors well in advance for their entertainment and leisure activities.

6. **Correlation Analysis:**
    - Correlation values, showing the maximum and minimum percentages, were demonstrated to enhance the percentage lying between those numbers by various means.

### Key Findings

1. **Target Region:**
    - The majority of guests come from Western European countries. It's recommended to allocate a significant portion of the budget to target this area.

2. **Hotel Type Distribution:**
    - Around 61.1% of bookings are for City hotels, and 38.9% bookings are for Resort hotels, indicating that City hotels are busier than Resort hotels. Thus, it's recommended to focus the most targeting funds on City hotels.

3. **Booking Months:**
    - May to August are the peak months due to the summer period. It's advisable to target advertisement during these months.

4. **Guest Advertisement:**
    - Target advertisement to increase returning guests, considering the absence of repeated guests.

5. **Booking Periods:**
    - November, December, February, and January have fewer bookings, so rooms can be booked with a lower average daily rate during these months. It's recommended to avoid the busiest months for hotels (May, June, July, August).

6. **Preferred Room Type:**
    - Room Type A is the most preferred among guests.

7. **Cancellation Rate:**
    - Around one-fourth of the total bookings get canceled.

8. **Top Booking Countries:**
    - Most bookings are made from Portugal and Great Britain.

9. **Hotel Preference:**
    - City Hotel seems to be more preferred among travelers, and it also generates more revenue and profit.
